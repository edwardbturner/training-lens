# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is `training-lens`, a library for interpreting fine-tune training runs of models. The repository is currently in its initial state with minimal codebase structure.

## Repository Structure

This is a new repository with the following initial structure:
- `README.md` - Basic project description
- `LICENSE` - MIT License
- `ai_docs/` - Persistent AI memory and documentation
- No source code, configuration files, or build system present yet

## Development Status

This repository appears to be in its initial setup phase. There are currently:
- No package managers configured (no package.json, requirements.txt, pyproject.toml, or Cargo.toml)
- No source code directories or files
- No test frameworks or build systems configured
- No development tooling setup (linting, formatting, etc.)

## Next Steps for Development

When beginning development on this project, you will need to:
1. Determine the target language/platform for the library
2. Set up appropriate package management and build tools
3. Create the basic project structure (src/, tests/, docs/, etc.)
4. Configure development tooling (linting, formatting, testing)
5. Implement the core functionality for interpreting training runs
